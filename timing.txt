## openLRSng  Timing info ##

PPM is normally sent aroound 50Hz i.e. a frame every 20ms. This is not something we can trust and some TX:s use variable frame length.

This is why openLRSng will use timing separate from PPM for radio communication to have well defined packet intervals for fast lost packet detection and recovery.

We currently use 11 byte packets at defineable datarate

Time needed for frame transmission at various data rates

4800 - 40380 us --- send frames at 20Hz (50ms) 
9600 - 20600 us -- send frames at 40Hz (25ms)
19200 - 10688 us -- send frames at 50Hz (20ms) room for telemetry backlink with smaller packet ??
38400 - ?us -- send frames at 50Hz telemetry frames at same rate
