openLRSng
=========

my fork of openLRS code (based on thUndeadMod of openLRS)

Please note that this version requires modifications to HW as the used pins are different to allow usage of HW timers.

Currently only "RX v2" modulu is supported as TX and RX.

TX:
  - PPM to ch5
  - button between ch4 and ground

RX:
  - PPM output at ch6
  - RSSI at tbs.
